An archive of my 3D modeling work from period 2011-2013.. 

I'm putting these here in the hope that they would be useful.  

Some of the models here have been manufactured into real products either by me
(using 3d printing) or by others. Other models were either used as marketing
material or as part of demo content.  

Note: some of the blender files may be slightly different from the ones used in
renderings below. I had to recover them from multiple backups over a span of a
few years so they are not necessarily latest version.
